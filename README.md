# Interesting places to visit in 2016

My employer wanted me to set up a plan of what conferences I wanted to visit this year, so here we go.

The branch all-conferences holds an objective listing of the conferences I know about. Feel free to clone or pull-request.

This branch (my-conferences) has conferences annotated with priority and subjective reasons for why I would like to go there.
